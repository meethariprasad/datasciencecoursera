Objective & Final Product
========================================================

This project is intended to create a product which can predict next word based on the words entered earlier(you might have already seen it in modern keyboards in mobile!).  

Following links will take you to the application and codebase, and following slides after this briefly explain how this product has been built.

- [Application](https://meethariprasad.shinyapps.io/predictword/): This link takes you to shinyapps where product is hosted.
- Code: This link takes you to github repository where final code is hosted.
